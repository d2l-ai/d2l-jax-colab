    "\n",
    "* We defined the network architectures\n",
    "  without specifying the input dimensionality.\n",
    "* We added layers without specifying\n",

    "  how many parameters our models should contain.\n",

    "You might be surprised that our code runs at all.\n",
    "After all, there is no way the deep learning framework\n",
    "could tell what the input dimensionality of a network would be.\n",
    "The trick here is that the framework *defers initialization*,\n",

    "what the dimensionality is\n",
