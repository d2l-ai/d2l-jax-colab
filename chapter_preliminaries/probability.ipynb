    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space\n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burglarized\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables\n",
    "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burglarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
    "Other times we write expressions\n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",
    "that is true for all of the values\n",
    "that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can take, i.e.,\n",
    "for all $i,j$ it holds that $P(X=i \\textrm{ and } Y=j) = P(X=i)P(Y=j)$.\n",
    "Other times, we abuse notation by writing\n",
    "$P(v)$ when the random variable is clear from the context.\n",
    "Since an event in probability theory is a set of outcomes from the sample space,\n",
    "we can specify a range of values for a random variable to take.\n",
    "For example, $P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$ denotes the probability of the event $\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a subtle difference\n",
    "between *discrete* random variables,\n",
    "like flips of a coin or tosses of a die,\n",
    "and *continuous* ones,\n",
    "like the weight and the height of a person\n",
    "sampled at random from the population.\n",
    "In this case we seldom really care about\n",
    "someone's exact height.\n",
    "Moreover, if we took precise enough measurements,\n",
    "we would find that no two people on the planet\n",
    "have the exact same height.\n",
    "In fact, with fine enough measurements,\n",
    "you would never have the same height\n",
    "when you wake up and when you go to sleep.\n",
    "There's little point in asking about\n",
    "the exact probability that someone\n",
    "is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall.\n",
    "Instead, we typically care more about being able to say\n",
    "whether someone's height falls into a given interval,\n",
    "say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters.\n",
    "In these cases we work with probability *densities*.\n",
    "The height of exactly 1.80 meters\n",
    "has no probability, but nonzero density.\n",
    "To get out the probability assigned to an interval,\n",
    "we must take an *integral* of the density\n",
    "over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we couldn't even\n",
    "make it past the last section without\n",
    "making statements involving interactions\n",
    "among multiple random variables\n",
    "(recall $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$).\n",
    "Most of machine learning\n",
    "is concerned with such relationships.\n",
    "Here, the sample space would be\n",
    "the population of interest,\n",
    "say customers who transact with a business,\n",
    "photographs on the internet,\n",
    "or proteins known to biologists.\n",
    "Each random variable would represent\n",
    "the (unknown) value of a different attribute.\n",
    "Whenever we sample an individual from the population,\n",
    "we observe a realization of each of the random variables.\n",
    "Because the values taken by random variables\n",
    "correspond to subsets of the sample space\n",
    "that could be overlapping, partially overlapping,\n",
    "or entirely disjoint,\n",
    "knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can cause us to update our beliefs\n",
    "about what values of another random variable are likely.\n",
    "If a patient walks into a hospital\n",
    "and we observe that they\n",
    "are having trouble breathing\n",
    "and have lost their sense of smell,\n",
    "then we believe that they are more likely\n",
    "to have COVID-19 than we might\n",
    "if they had no trouble breathing\n",
    "and a perfectly ordinary sense of smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multiple random variables,\n",
    "we can construct events corresponding\n",
    "to every combination of values\n",
    "that the variables can jointly take.\n",
    "The probability function that assigns\n",
    "probabilities to each of these combinations\n",
    "(e.g. $A=a$ and $B=b$)\n",
    "is called the *joint probability* function\n",
    "and simply returns the probability assigned\n",
    "to the intersection of the corresponding subsets\n",
    "of the sample space.\n",
    "The *joint probability* assigned to the event\n",
    "where random variables $A$ and $B$\n",
    "take values $a$ and $b$, respectively,\n",
    "is denoted $P(A = a, B = b)$,\n",
    "where the comma indicates \"and\".\n",
    "Note that for any values $a$ and $b$,\n",
    "it holds that\n",
    "$P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(A=a)$\n",
    "and $P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(B = b)$,\n",
    "since for $A=a$ and $B=b$ to happen,\n",
    "$A=a$ has to happen *and* $B=b$ also has to happen.\n",
    "Interestingly, the joint probability\n",
    "tells us all that we can know about these\n",
    "random variables in a probabilistic sense,\n",
    "and can be used to derive many other\n",
    "useful quantities, including recovering the\n",
    "individual distributions $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.\n",
    "To recover $P(A=a)$ we simply sum up\n",
    "$P(A=a, B=v)$ over all values $v$\n",
    "that the random variable $B$ can take:\n",
    "$P(A=a) = \\sum_v P(A=a, B=v)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} \\leq 1$\n",
    "turns out to be extremely important.\n",
    "It is called the *conditional probability*,\n",
    "and is denoted via the \"$\\mid$\" symbol,\n",
    "$P(B=b \\mid A=a) = P(A=a,B=b)/P(A=a)$.\n",
    "It tells us the new probability\n",
    "associated with the event $B=b$,\n",
    "once we condition on the fact $A=a$ took place.\n",
    "We can think of this conditional probability\n",
    "as restricting attention only to the subset\n",
    "of the sample space associated with $A=a$\n",
    "and then renormalizing so that\n",
    "all probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "Conditional probabilities\n",
    "are in fact probabilities\n",
    "and thus respect all of the axioms,\n",
    "so long as we condition all terms\n",
    "on the same event and thus\n",
    "restrict attention to the same sample space.\n",
    "For instance, for disjoint events\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathcal{B}'$, we have that\n",
    "$P(\\mathcal{B} \\cup \\mathcal{B}' \\mid A = a) = P(\\mathcal{B} \\mid A = a) + P(\\mathcal{B}' \\mid A = a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition of conditional probabilities,\n",
    "we can derive the famous result called *Bayes' theorem*.\n",
    "By construction, we have that $P(A, B) = P(B\\mid A) P(A)$\n",
    "and $P(A, B) = P(A\\mid B) P(B)$.\n",
    "Combining both equations yields\n",
    "$P(B\\mid A) P(A) = P(A\\mid B) P(B)$ and hence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B\\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple equation has profound implications because\n",
    "it allows us to reverse the order of conditioning.\n",
    "If we know how to estimate $P(B\\mid A)$, $P(A)$, and $P(B)$,\n",
    "then we can estimate $P(A\\mid B)$.\n",
    "We often find it easier to estimate one term directly\n",
    "but not the other and Bayes' theorem can come to the rescue here.\n",
    "For instance, if we know the prevalence of symptoms for a given disease,\n",
    "and the overall prevalences of the disease and symptoms, respectively,\n",
    "we can determine how likely someone is\n",
    "to have the disease based on their symptoms.\n",
    "In some cases we might not have direct access to $P(B)$,\n",
    "such as the prevalence of symptoms.\n",
    "In this case a simplified version of Bayes' theorem comes in handy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) \\propto P(B \\mid A) P(A).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $P(A \\mid B)$ must be normalized to $1$, i.e., $\\sum_a P(A=a \\mid B) = 1$,\n",
    "we can use it to compute\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{\\sum_a P(B \\mid A=a) P(A = a)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian statistics, we think of an observer\n",
    "as possessing some (subjective) prior beliefs\n",
    "about the plausibility of the available hypotheses\n",
    "encoded in the *prior* $P(H)$,\n",
    "and a *likelihood function* that says how likely\n",
    "one is to observe any value of the collected evidence\n",
    "for each of the hypotheses in the class $P(E \\mid H)$.\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is then interpreted as telling us\n",
    "how to update the initial *prior* $P(H)$\n",
    "in light of the available evidence $E$\n",
    "to produce *posterior* beliefs\n",
    "$P(H \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H) P(H)}{P(E)}$.\n",
    "Informally, this can be stated as\n",
    "\"posterior equals prior times likelihood, divided by the evidence\".\n",
    "Now, because the evidence $P(E)$ is the same for all hypotheses,\n",
    "we can get away with simply normalizing over the hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\sum_a P(A=a \\mid B) = 1$ also allows us to *marginalize* over random variables. That is, we can drop variables from a joint distribution such as $P(A, B)$. After all, we have that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_a P(B \\mid A=a) P(A=a) = \\sum_a P(B, A=a) = P(B).$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",

    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we denote that uncertainty\n",

    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty\n",
    "concerning the probability\n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",

    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin,\n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain\n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms owe to literature in mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :citet:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It is worth noting that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution\n",

    "    1. Formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the return while keeping the variance constrained to an upper bound. This is the Nobel-Prize winning [Markovitz portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model) :cite:`Mangram.2013`. To solve it you will need a quadratic programming solver, something way beyond the scope of this book.\n"
