    "    1. How would you shuffle the data if it is held on disk? Your task is to design an *efficient* algorithm that does not require too many random reads or writes. Hint: [pseudorandom permutation generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation) allow you to design a reshuffle without the need to store the permutation table explicitly :cite:`Naor.Reingold.1999`. \n",
